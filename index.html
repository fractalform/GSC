<div id="explain">Global Solstice Calendar (<em>year.month.day</em>) - Today's Date:</div>
  <div id="timedate"></div>
<div id="body">The global solstice calendar, or GSC, is a 13-month calendar with 28 days per month. It is loosely based on the International Fixed Calendar, except that the start of each year is referenced based on the current December 21 solstice. Since our planetary body serves as our reference point in the solar system, this calendar tracks each day throughout a year based on solar reference.
<br /><br />  
The solstice is significant because it is the day of the year that in the southern hemisphere receives the most sunlight and the longest day, and in the northern hemisphere, the least sunlight and the shortest day. As a solar calendar, it is an earth-based reference for our solar system and celebrates each year based on the balanced exchange of solar energy from solstice to solstice. Month 7, day 14 marks the central or "Mid Day" of the year where the direction of the solstice reverses and returns toward equilibrium. 
<br /><br />  
Since the calendar's 13 months each have 4, 7-day weeks, the calendar contains 364 days symmetrically. This means that there is one day each year marked "Sol Day," or "Day Zero," or "Day of the Sun," which appears in the calendar as "00.00," and is referenced in the Gregorian calendar as "December 21." Sol Day ends the previous year, and the following day, "01.01," marks New Year's Day. Every 4th year (with some exceptions) sees a leap year, similar to our leap year except that it always is the day that precedes Sol Day. Leap day is displayed as "--.--"
<br /><br /> 
The last addition to the GSC is the year modifier, which you will notice adds 10,000 years to our current year. This follows the Holocene or Human Era (HE) calendar scheme first proposed by scientist Cesare Emiliani in 1993. Taking the concept of the HE calendar into the GSC encompasses a broader range of human history that is more indicative of the scope of human civilizations around the globe, unlike the Gregorian model which is bound predominantly to Western culture.
<br /><br />
I currently do not have month names that would make sense throughout the globe, though there is something at least mathematically universal in keeping the months and days as just numbers, since there is a language analog for numbers in cultures all over the world. I also imagined it might be interesting to name each month after basic elements from the periodic table, such as:
  <ul>
    <li>01: Hydrogen</li>
    <li>02: Helium</li>
    <li>03: Lithium</li>
    <li>04: Beryllium</li>
    <li>05: Boron</li>
    <li>06: Carbon</li>
    <li>07: Nitrogen</li>
    <li>08: Oxygen</li>
    <li>09: Fluorine</li>
    <li>10: Neon</li>
    <li>11: Sodium</li>
    <li>12: Magnesium</li>
    <li>13: Aluminum</li>
  </ul>
Admittedly, these names don't flow very well at first (or second) speaking, but people got used to "February," "March," "April," and so on, so maybe there's not to much that would need to be done to the element names to make them work as month names. The atomic weight logic, at least, makes sense. <br /> <br />
Days of the week can remain the same from language to language, or simply adhere just to their number as well.
